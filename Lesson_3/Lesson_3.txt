Lesson 3 : Control Flow

1. control flow statements
    + Control flow means how JavaScript decides which code to run, and when. 
    + It includes conditions and loops.
    + Control fow there are 3 types :
        - Conditional statements
        - Iteration(Loops) statements
        - Jump statements

2. Conditional statements
    + Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
    + There are 3 types of conditional statements in JavaScript:
        - if statement
        - if...else statement
        - if...else if...else statement
        - switch statement

3. if statement
    + The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    + Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        }
    + Example:
        let x = 10;
        if (x > 5) {
            console.log("x is greater than 5");
        }

4. if...else statement
    + The if...else statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
    + Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if condition is true
        } else {
            // code to be executed if condition is false
        }
    + Example:
        let x = 10;
        if (x > 5) {
            console.log("x is greater than 5");
        } else {
            console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
        }

5. if...else if...else statement
    + The if...else if...else statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions.
    + Syntax:
        if (condition1) {
            // code to be executed if condition1 is true
        } else if (condition2) {
            // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
        } else {
            // code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
        }
    + Example:
        let x = 10;
        if (x > 20) {
            console.log("x is greater than 20");
        } else if (x > 10) {
            console.log("x is greater than 10");
        } else {
            console.log("x is less than or equal to 10");
        }

6. switch statement
    + The switch statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on different values of a variable.
    + Syntax:
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // code to be executed if expression is equal to value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // code to be executed if expression is equal to value2
                break;
            // ...
            default:
                // code to be executed if none of the above cases match
        }
    + Example:
        let day = "Monday";
        switch (day) {
            case "Monday":
                console.log("Today is Monday");
                break;
            case "Tuesday":
                console.log("Today is Tuesday");
                break;
            case "Wednesday":
                console.log("Today is Wednesday");
                break;
            case "Thursday":
                console.log("Today is Thursday");
                break;
            case "Friday":
                console.log("Today is Friday");
                break;
            case "Saturday":
                console.log("Today is Saturday");
                break;
            case "Sunday":
                console.log("Today is Sunday");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Invalid day");
        }

7. Iteration(Loops) statements
    + Iteration(Loops) statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
    + There are three types of iteration statements in JavaScript:
        - for loop
        - while loop
        - do...while loop
        - for...of loop
        - for...in loop

8. for loop
    + The for loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
    + The syntax of the for loop is:
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    + The initialization statement is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
    + The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
    + If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed.
    + If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.
    + The increment/decrement statement is executed after each iteration of the loop.
    + Example:
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    + Output:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4

9. while loop
    + The while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    + The syntax of the while loop is:
        while (condition) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    + The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
    + If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed.
    + If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.
    + Example:
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }
    + Output:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4

10. do-while loop
    + The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code inside the loop at least once, even if the condition is false.
    + The syntax of the do-while loop is:
        do {
            // code to be executed
        } while (condition);
    + The condition is evaluated after each iteration of the loop.
    + If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed again.
    + If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.
    + Example:
        let i = 0;
        do {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 5);
    + Output:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4

11. for...of loop
    + The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, and sets.
    + The syntax of the for...of loop is:
        for (let variable of iterable) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    + The variable is assigned the value of the next element in the iterable object on each iteration of the loop.
    + Example:
        let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
        for (let fruit of fruits) {
            console.log(fruit);
        }
    + Output:
        apple
        banana
        orange

12. for...in loop
    + The for...in loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.
    + The syntax of the for...in loop is:
        for (let property in object) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    + The property is assigned the name of the next enumerable property of the object on each iteration of the loop.
    + Example:
        let person = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
        for (let property in person) {
            console.log(property + ': ' + person[property]);
        }
    + Output:
        name: John
        age: 30
        city: New York

13. Jump statements in JavaScript
    + Jump statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
    + there are four jump statements in JavaScript:
        - break
        - continue
        - return
        - throw

14. break
    + The break statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement.
    + Example:
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i === 5) {
                break;
            }
            console.log(i);
        }
    + Output:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4

15. continue
    + The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
    + Example:
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i === 5) {
                continue;
            }
            console.log(i);
        }
    + Output:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
        6
        7
        8
        9

16. return
    + The return statement is used to exit a function and optionally return a value.
    + Example:
        function add(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        console.log(add(2, 3));
    + Output:
        5

17. throw
    + The throw statement is used to throw an exception.
    + Example:
        try {
            throw new Error("Something went wrong");
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error.message);
        }
    + Output:
        Something went wrong
