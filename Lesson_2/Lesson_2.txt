Lesson 2 : JavaScript Basics

1. Variables
    + A variable is a container for storing data values.
    + In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords.
    + Ways to declare variables:
        - var: function-scoped or globally-scoped variable (Old way not recommended)
        - let: block-scoped variable
        - const: block-scoped variable that value cannot be changed (constant)
    + Example:
        ```javascript
        var x = 5;
        let y = 10;
        const z = 15;
        ```
2. Rule for naming variables
    - Variables must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
    - Cannot start with a number.
    - Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age).
    - Use camelCase → studentName, phoneNumber.

3. Data Types : 
    + Data types are used to classify different types of data.
    + Primitive :
        - String: A sequence of characters, Ex: "Hello, world!"
        - Number: A numerical value, Ex: 42, 3.14
        - Boolean: A true or false value, Ex: true, false
        - Undefined: A value that is not defined, Ex: undefined
        - Null: A special value that represents the absence of a value, Ex: null
        - Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value, Ex: Symbol("unique")
        - BigInt: A primitive data type for representing arbitrarily large integers, Ex: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
    + Objects (Non-primitive) :
        - Object: A collection of properties, Ex: {name: "John", age: 30}
        - Array: A collection of elements, Ex: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        - Function: A block of code that can be executed, Ex: function myFunction() { /* code */ }

4. Operators :
    + Arithmetic Operators : 
        - Addition (+)
        - Subtraction (-)
        - Multiplication (*)
        - Division (/)
        - Modulus (%)
        - Exponentiation (**)
    + Assignment Operators : 
        - Assignment (=)
        - Addition Assignment (+=)
        - Subtraction Assignment (-=)
        - Multiplication Assignment (*=)
        - Division Assignment (/=)
        - Modulus Assignment (%=)
        - Exponentiation Assignment (**=)
    + Comparison Operators : 
        - Equality (==)
        - Strict Equality (===)
        - Inequality (!=)
        - Strict Inequality (!==)
        - Greater Than (>)
        - Less Than (<)
        - Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
        - Less Than or Equal To (<=)
    + Logical Operators : 
        - Logical AND (&&)
        - Logical OR (||)
        - Logical NOT (!)
    + String Operators :
        - Concatenation (+)
        - String Interpolation (`${variable}`)
